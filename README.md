# TrajectoryPlanner
A program for calculating the trajectory of a wheeled robot using time and speed vectors.

In this program, you will be able to plot the trajectory of a robot with a chassis:
1 - according to the velocity and time vector predefined in the program.
2 - by a square, the side of which you can set yourself.
3 - along a curved line. You can also set the radiuses of the circle segments and the length of the straight line via the terminal.

The left wheel is marked with red color.
The right wheel is marked with green color.
The center of gravity is marked in black.

How the program works:
If you select 1, the trajectory is drawn based on the velocity and time vectors already predetermined.
If you select 2/3, the velocity and time vectors are generated from the preset values, and then the trajectory is drawn based on these vectors.

There is a .jar file that you can launch using this command in Command Prompt: java -jar TrajectoryPlanner-1.jar
